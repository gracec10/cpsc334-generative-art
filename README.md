# Growth

### Approach
For me, the concept of "generative" immediately brings my mind to nature. I've always been fascinated by how living things are so tightly structured yet also so free flowing, and how it all relies on a kind of gorgeous randomness growing within a system, a perfect balance. Another thing weighing on my mind that I wanted to explore is how people, who are also living things, come in and upset that balance in such a destructive manner. The urge to control land and life for the purpose of production is so tightly woven in our lives, and I wanted to emphasize an appreciation for the value in the beautiful organized freedom that governs nature, and at our core, govern us as natural beings!

These are fractal-like trees, imposed onto a bright wintry day.
